Load Tests
Test Case 1: Workflow Verification with Large Data Load
Objective: Verify if the workflow functions correctly when handling a large amount of files.
Preconditions: A dataset containing 1 month’s worth of files (or equivalent large dataset) is available for testing.
Steps:
Upload the dataset into the system.
Start the workflow and monitor the process.
Expected Results:
The workflow should initiate and complete without errors.
All tasks in the workflow should proceed as expected without interruption.
Test Case 2: File Processing Verification
Objective: Ensure all files are processed accurately within the workflow.
Preconditions: The system should have tracking logs or mechanisms to verify the status of processed files.
Steps:
Trigger the workflow on a large dataset (e.g., 1 month’s worth of files).
Monitor each file’s status or check logs to confirm they are being processed.
Expected Results:
Every file in the dataset should be processed without errors.
The final output for each file should match expected results or transformations.
Test Case 3: Workflow Timeout Check
Objective: Determine if the workflow experiences timeouts after prolonged execution (1-2 days).
Preconditions: Configure the environment for continuous execution monitoring, with logging enabled to track any timeout events.
Steps:
Start the workflow with a large dataset and allow it to run for 1-2 days.
Observe for any timeout messages, errors, or interruptions in processing.
Expected Results:
The workflow should complete without timeouts or abrupt stops.
In case of timeout, the system should log the timeout event and provide information on where the issue occurred.
Test Case 4: Processing Time Measurement
Objective: Measure and evaluate the time taken to process a specified amount of files.
Preconditions: Ensure timestamp logging is enabled at the start and end of processing each file.
Steps:
Trigger the workflow to process a specific quantity of files (e.g., 1 week’s worth).
Measure the start and end times to calculate total processing time.
Expected Results:
Processing time should fall within an acceptable range for the system’s capacity.
Identify and document any deviations from expected processing times.
Test Case 5: Identification of Additional Issues and Concerns
Objective: Detect any additional issues or bottlenecks encountered during large file processing.
Preconditions: Logging and monitoring systems should be active to capture unexpected behaviors.
Steps:
Run the workflow with a large dataset and monitor for any unusual logs, errors, or slowdowns.
Document any issues not anticipated in previous test cases.
Expected Results:
No unexpected errors, warnings, or performance drops.
Any issues identified should be documented for further analysis and remediation.
