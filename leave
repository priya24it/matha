Subject: Leave of Absence Request from February 27 to March 15, 2025

Dear [Manager's Name],

I am writing to formally request leave from February 27, 2025, to March 15, 2025, due to [mention reason briefly if appropriate, such as "personal matters" or "family commitments"]. During this time, I will ensure that all my responsibilities are managed to minimize any disruption.

Before my leave, I will complete any outstanding tasks and work closely with my team to delegate any necessary duties. I will also make sure to hand over any ongoing projects to [colleagueâ€™s name or team] and provide them with any required information to ensure a seamless transition.

Please let me know if there are any forms or additional procedures I should complete before my leave. I appreciate your understanding and support.

Thank you for considering my request.
